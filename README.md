# TripleTen_projects
Projects I worked on while attending the Data Analysis TripleTen Bootcamp.


| Project number | Title | Description |
| :-----------: | ----------- |----------- |
| 1 | TV Show Ratings| The aim of this project is to investigate how the number of votes a title receives from IMDb users impacts its ratings.|
| 2 | [Instacart](https://github.com/zarina-perez/TripleTen_projects/tree/main/02-EDA_project) | The project task was to prepare a report that gives insight into the shopping habits of Instacart customers.|
| 3 | Telecom Operator Megaline | The commercial department wants to know which of the plans brings in more revenue in order to adjust the advertising budget.|
| 4 | Software Development Tools | Develop and deploy a web application to a cloud service so that it is accessible to the public on car sales.|
| 5 | Video Game Success | Identify patterns that determine whether a game succeeds or not.|
| 6 | SQL Ride Share | Understand passenger preferences and the impact of external factors on rides. Analyze data from competitors and test a hypothesis about the impact of weather on ride frequency.|
| 7 | Machine Learning Megaline | Develop a model that would analyze subscribers' behavior and recommend one of Megaline's newer plans: Smart or Ultra.|
| 8 | Beta Bank Customers | I predicted whether a customer will leave the bank soon.|
| 9 | Machine Learning OilyGiant Mining | The task is to find the best place for a new well.|
| 10 | Machine Learning Model Zyfra | The model should predict the amount of gold recovered from gold ore.|
| 11 | Linear Algerba Sure Tommorow Insurance | Task 1: Find customers who are similar to a given customer. This will help the company's agents with marketing. Task 2: Predict whether a new customer is likely to receive an insurance benefit. Can a trained prediction model do better than an untrained dummy model? Can it do worse? Explain your logic. Task 3: Predict the number of insurance benefits a new customer is likely to receive using a linear regression model. Task 4: Protect clients' personal data without breaking the model from the previous task.|
| 12 | Rusty Bargain Car Sales | Developing an app to attract new customers. In that app, you can quickly find out the market value of your car. I built the model to determine the value.|
| 13 | Sweet Lift Taxi | To attract more drivers during peak hours, we need to predict the amount of taxi orders for the next hour. I built a model for such a prediction.|
| 14 | Film Junky Union Movie Reviews | The goal is to train a model to automatically detect negative reviews.|
| 15 | Good Seed Supermarket | Making sure they do not sell alcohol to people underage. The shops are equipped with cameras in the checkout area which are triggered when a person is buying alcohol. Computer vision methods can be used to determine age of a person from a photo.The task then is to build and evaluate a model for verifying people's age|
| 16 | Telcom Operator Interconnect | Be able to forecast their churn of clients with a machine learning model.|
