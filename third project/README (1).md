# Which One is a Better Plan? Megaline Telecom Analysis

## Project Overview

This project involves analyzing customer behavior for the telecom operator Megaline, which offers two prepaid plans: Surf and Ultimate. The goal is to determine which plan generates more revenue, helping the commercial department optimize the advertising budget.

### Objective

The main objective is to carry out a preliminary analysis of the two prepaid plans based on a dataset of 500 Megaline clients. By examining customer usage patterns, including calls, messages, and internet data, the project aims to identify which plan is more profitable.

### Dataset

The dataset consists of five separate files containing information about calls, messages, internet usage, customer details, and the specifics of each plan. The data covers client activities in 2018.

### Project Stages

#### 1. Data Exploration and Preparation

- Loaded and explored the datasets for missing values and duplicates.
- Converted relevant columns to appropriate data types (e.g., datetime).
- Rounded up call durations and internet usage as per Megaline's policy.

#### 2. Data Aggregation

- Aggregated data per user per month to simplify analysis.
- Calculated total minutes, messages, and internet usage for each user.

#### 3. Data Analysis

- **User Behavior**: Compared the average call duration, number of messages, and internet usage between the two plans.
- **Revenue Calculation**: Calculated the monthly revenue generated by each user based on their plan and usage.
- **Statistical Testing**: Conducted t-tests to determine if the differences in revenue between the plans were statistically significant.

### Findings

- **Revenue Insights**: The Surf plan, on average, generates higher monthly revenue than the Ultimate plan. However, the variability in revenue is also higher for Surf users.
- **User Engagement**: Surf users tend to send more messages and use more internet data as the year progresses, indicating higher engagement with the plan.
- **Statistical Significance**: Despite the observed differences in revenue, the t-test results suggest that the differences are not statistically significant based on the available data.

### Tools and Technologies

- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Scipy**: For statistical testing.
- **Python**: The programming language used for all data processing tasks.

## Usage Instructions

### Requirements

- **Python 3.8+**
- **Pandas**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Seaborn**
- **Scipy**

### Running the Project

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have the required Python packages installed.
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook provided to reproduce the analysis and results.

## Conclusion

The analysis suggests that the Surf plan might be more profitable than the Ultimate plan due to higher average revenue and user engagement. However, the lack of statistical significance in the findings indicates that further data collection and analysis are needed before making definitive conclusions.

## Future Improvements

1. **Expand Dataset**: Include more users and data points to strengthen the analysis.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Explore additional features, such as customer location, to see if they impact revenue.
3. **Predictive Modeling**: Implement machine learning models to predict customer plan preferences and optimize pricing strategies.

Overall, the project provides valuable insights into customer behavior and plan profitability, offering a foundation for further exploration and business strategy development.
