    "Handling Missing Data:\n",
    "\n",
    "   Difficulty: Encountered significant missing data in various features, which initially led to over-reliance on _nan indicators.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Solution: Used median imputation for numerical features and treated missing values in categorical features as a separate category. Explored other imputation strategies but found this approach effective given the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Class Imbalance:\n",
    "\n",
    "   Difficulty: The target variable (churn) was imbalanced, which could have biased the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Solution: Applied class weighting in both the Logistic Regression and Random Forest models, ensuring that the models were not biased toward the majority class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpreting Feature Importance:\n",
    "\n",
    "   Difficulty: The presence of _nan indicators in feature importance analysis suggested potential issues with how missing data were being handled.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Solution: Considered removing or treating _nan features differently, but ultimately retained them to maintain model performance. Highlighted this as an area for further improvement."

    "This report summarizes the steps taken to develop a predictive model for customer churn, the challenges faced, and the final outcomes. The final model, a Random Forest, achieved high accuracy and AUC-ROC, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting churn. Further work could focus on refining the handling of missing data and exploring additional model types or feature engineering techniques."
